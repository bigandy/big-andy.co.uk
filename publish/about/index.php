			<h1>About Big Andy</h1>
			<p>Born on 24<sup>th</sup> October (Scorpio) 1980 (monkey) the eldest child of Colleen - a GP - and Clive Hudson - a Civil Engineer and Project Manager. I have a younger brother,
			<a href="http://www.rob-hudson.com" title="my bro">Robert</a>, who lives in London and is a successful Internet Software Consultant.</p>
			<p>At the University of Manchester I studied Chemistry (I graduated with MChem(hons)) discovered hundreds of excellent
			bands, learnt how to do an eskimo roll (kayaking) and how to juggle.</p>
			<p>I have recently changed career &#8211; thus fulfilling a decade-long ambition to work on the web &#8211; and become a front-end website developer.</p>
			<p>Currently I am revising for the final module of my Masters CIW course and after this I will start learning French.</p>
			<p>I live in Reading, UK, with my fianc&#233;e, <a href="http://www.marionmouttou.co.uk" title="my girlfriend">Marion</a>, but we hope to move to France
			in the next 3 years e.g. to Lyon.</p>
			<p>My interests are running, web-design, juggling, music, photography and cinema. I also love to cook deserts and drink beer.</p>	
			
			<h2>Why bigandy?</h2>
			<p>In the final year of my university course I joined the Manchester University Canoe Club
			and on the end of year trip to go Kayaking in the French Alps. There were two Andys, Army Andy and Big Andy. </p>
