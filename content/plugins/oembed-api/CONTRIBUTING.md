# Contributing to oEmbed API

## Slack

Discussions happen in the [#feature-oembed](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/feature-oembed/) WordPress Slack channel.

## Pull Requests

Code is developed on feature branches. Pull requests are where we discuss the development in progress, and determine whether a given feature branch is ready for merging to master.

Please create your pull request as soon as you start work on a branch. If you are working on the pull request, assign it to yourself. If you’re want feedback from someone else, assign the pull request to them.

Remember to check your diff regularly to make sure you’re only changing code you expect to be.

When creating a branch, please use the following naming structure: (number of original Github issue)-followed-by-keywords-describing-the-project.

When creating a pull request, please use a clear title and reference the issue in the pull request description.
