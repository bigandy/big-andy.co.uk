# Bigandy

This is the fourth encarnation of the big-andy.co.uk site and this time I wanted to push myself further applying the skills that I have learnt in the last 18 months. I will use newer technologies (Gulp, Sass, SVG, Bower, and possibly the [WP API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)).

Aims are speed, lightness, and encorporating new technologies.
